altSPI
======

Alternative Energia SPI library for Stellaris / Tiva LaunchPads.
Based on SPI library of Reaper7 and Rei Vilo (http://forum.stellarisiti.com/topic/620-two-spi-modules/).  Allows use of spi modules that are not supported by original Energia SPI library.  In addition, two commands (trans2ByteA and trans2ByteB) are defined that allow transfer of 16 bit data.  Two files (altSPI.h and altSPI.cpp) must be added to "libraries" sub-folder of sketchbook folder to use altSPI.
